      <p>To put it simply, implicit bias is when our brains make quick judgements or assumptions about people or situations without us realizing it, usually based on stereotypes we've picked up from society. These biases happen automatically, and even if we don't consciously believe them, they can still influence our actions and decisions. Implicit biases develop from social stereotypes or from family within, and can very much influence behavior. Everyone has an implicit bias, being aware of it is important as that will allow one to reduce it or think a bit more about their actions.</p>

      <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
       <figure>
        <img src="images/diverse.webp" alt="People bunched together illustrating intersecting identities">
        <figcaption><strong>"Identities overlap; experiences aren’t one-variable."</strong></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Regarding intersectionality, it is the idea that people's identities such as race, gender, class, and sexuality do not exist separately from each other, but infact overlap and interact in ways that create unique experiences of advantage or disadvantage. It explains how someone can face multiple kinds of discrimination at once and why their experience cannot be fully understood by looking at just one identity alone. Being able to look at all the different aspects of one's identity and understanding how they come together to create experiences of priviledge and/or discrimination is very beneficial.</p>
