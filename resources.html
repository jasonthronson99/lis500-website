    <h2>Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p>To put it simply, implicit bias is when our brains make quick judgements or assumptions about people or situations without us realizing it, usually based on stereotypes we've picked up from society. These biases happen automatically, and even if we don't consciously believe them, they can still influence our actions and decisions.</p>

    <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
    <p>Regarding intersectionality, it is the idea that people's identities such as race, gender, class, and sexuality do not exist separately from each other, but infact overlap and interact in ways that create unique experiences of advantage or disadvantage. It explains how someone can face multiple kinds of discrimination at once and why their experience cannot be fully understood by looking at just one identity alone.</p>
