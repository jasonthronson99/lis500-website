          <p>Empress (or EMPRESS) is a video-game hacker whose primary goal is to remove anti-piracy measures in certain triple a video game titles, specifically video games that use the "Denuvo" software as their anti-piracy tool. This is because Denuvo is known to be extremely invasive to the operating system, in that it even goes beyond the operating system which is considered extremely unethical. Ever since 2014, she would just charge $500 per game and then be able to crack it within a short amount of time, making her stand out immensely among her peers. In particular, she was able to crack Hogwarts Legacy in just 12 days, despite anti-piracy tools like Denuvo being extremely complicated as well as having obfuscated code.</p>

          <p>Issra Omer is Product Director at Spotify. She has previously worked at Meta/Facebook and she studied at Stanford. Her accomplishments include creating Spotify’s lyric feature and working on the freemium experience as well. She has also spoken out about her career as a Black woman in tech. As a minority and a woman in the tech field, I really felt like we were similar in that way. I liked how she was a figure I could look up to while also being a woman in the tech field. I also really enjoy listening to Spotify music and the lyrics feature of it is something I really liked. So, knowing she was the one who worked on it was really cool. I think she matters as a tech hero because while her focus is on product innovation, I really like her speaking out about her challenges as a woman of color. Also seeing her in a senior role as a woman of color is very inspiring as this is an industry with not as much representation. She also supports community spaces such as Black Product Managers Europe which just again shows a lot about her character.</p>

          <p>Yeshimabeit “Yeshi” Milner is a technologist, activist, and co-founder of Data for Black Lives (D4BL). This is an organization using data science to advance racial justice and expose how algorithms can reinforce inequality.
            Growing up in Miami, she saw firsthand how biased data was used to criminalize Black communities, inspiring her mission to reclaim data as a tool for liberation.
            Under her leadership, D4BL promotes “data justice,” empowering marginalized groups to control how data about them is used.
            Milner challenges the idea that technology is neutral, arguing that true equity in tech requires structural change, not just diversity programs.
            Her work bridges activism and technology, showing how data can fight injustice instead of deepening it.</p>
